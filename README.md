# [Toast Editor](http://toastedware.com)

Toast Editor is a fast web-based HTML5 level editor that exports your
creations for multiple languages, game frameworks and editors including FlashPunk, Toast, C++, AS3 and Ogmo Editor. 


It's a great choice for fast prototyping or during game jams: it exports
your creation directly in your favorite API, without your code even knowing about
a specific XML format.
Then, if you need it, you can further customize your level with Ogmo Editor using the simple
export feature.

This project has been created by me ([Danny Calleri](http//www.twitter.com/dannycalleri)) as
the perfect companion for [Toast Framework](https://github.com/dannycalleri/toast), a simple C++ 2D game framework.
